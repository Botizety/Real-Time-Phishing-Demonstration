## Project Summary

This project is a standalone reverse proxy server, built in Python and Flask, designed to simulate advanced phishing campaigns. It can clone dynamic, JavaScript-rendered websites in real-time by proxying live traffic, rewriting HTML content on the fly to capture form submissions. This tool effectively demonstrates how modern phishing attacks can bypass simple defenses by acting as a man-in-the-middle, serving live content from the target site to the user.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Reverse Proxy:** Runs as a single Flask application, requiring no complex setup.
- **Live Content Serving:** Fetches and serves content directly from the target site in real-time.
- **Dynamic HTML Rewriting:** Uses BeautifulSoup to parse live HTML and rewrite links, image sources, and form actions to keep the user within the proxy environment.
- **Credential Capture:** Intercepts `POST` requests from login forms and logs captured data to a local text file.
- **Publicly Deployable:** Can be easily exposed to the public internet for realistic testing scenarios using `ngrok`.

## The Development Journey & Challenges Overcome

The development of this tool was an iterative process that involved diagnosing and bypassing multiple layers of modern web application security.

- **Initial Failure:** An early version using simple `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to create a static clone failed against modern targets like Steam, because their login pages are rendered dynamically with JavaScript.

- **Advanced Interception:** To overcome this, the project was re-architected into a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** tool using `mitmproxy`. This allowed for the interception of live traffic and the injection of custom JavaScript to hijack form submission events.

- **Diagnosing Real-World Defenses:** While testing with `mitmproxy`, several professional-grade security features were encountered and analyzed:
    - **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** A browser-level security policy that prevents users from ignoring certificate warnings. This required learning specific browser bypass techniques used by security testers.
    - **Server-Side Anti-Botting:** Sophisticated targets like Facebook were found to use redirect loops to trap and block non-browser traffic, demonstrating the limitations of script-based requests.

- **Final Architecture:** The final version is a standalone Flask application that acts as its own reverse proxy. This architecture provides the most stable and portable solution, successfully cloning medium-difficulty HTTPS sites like the GitHub login page in a real-world test scenario.

## Setup and Usage

This project requires Python and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-folder>
    ```

2.  **Set up Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install required libraries
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure the Target:**
    * Open `app.py` and modify the `TARGET_HOST` and `TARGET_PROTOCOL` variables to your desired test site.

4.  **Run the Server:**
    * In your first terminal, start the Flask application.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5.  **Expose to the Internet (Optional, for "real-world" testing):**
    * In a second terminal, use `ngrok` to create a public URL for your local server.
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
    * Use the public `https://...` URL provided by `ngrok` as your phishing link.

6.  **Check Results:**
    * Captured credentials will be saved to `captured_credentials.txt` in the project directory.
